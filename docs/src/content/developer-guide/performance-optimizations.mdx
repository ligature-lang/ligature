2. **Environment Sharing/Pooling**: Minimal environment setup for regular functions

   - Efficient parent environment linking without cloning
   - Reduced memory allocation overhead
   - Optimized for both simple and complex function patterns

3. **Direct Function Evaluation**: Parameter substitution for simple functions

**Impact**: Framework in place for future expression-level optimizations.

### 4. Memory Allocation Optimization

**Problem**: Excessive allocations in hot paths.

**Solutions**:

- Pre-allocated HashMap capacity for record fields
- Reduced cloning in environment operations
- Optimized pattern matching with early termination

**Impact**: Reduced memory pressure and allocation overhead.

### 5. Pattern Matching Optimization

**Problem**: Inefficient union pattern matching with unnecessary checks.

**Solution**:

- Early termination for non-union values
- Early termination for variant mismatches
- Optimized binding collection

**Impact**: Significantly improved pattern matching performance.

### 6. Benchmark Infrastructure

**Problem**: Lack of comprehensive performance measurement tools.

**Solution**:

- Comprehensive benchmark suite with multiple test categories
- Memory usage tracking
- Throughput calculations
- CSV export functionality
