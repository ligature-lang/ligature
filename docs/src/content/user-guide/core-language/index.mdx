# Core Language Features

This section covers the fundamental language features and syntax of Ligature.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Language Reference](language-reference.md)** - Complete reference for Ligature syntax and features
- **[Examples](examples.md)** - Practical examples and use cases
- **[Constraint-Based Validation](constraint-validation.md)** - Create types with built-in validation rules

## Core Language Concepts

Ligature's core language is built around several key concepts:

### Type System
- **Union types** with full evaluation and pattern matching
- **Type inference** and constraint solving
- **Advanced subtyping** and dependent types
- **Refinement types** with runtime validation

### Syntax and Structure
- **ML-family syntax** - Familiar and accessible
- **Pattern matching** with guards and variable binding
- **Operator precedence** system
- **Module system** with imports and exports

### Data Management
- **Configuration-focused** design
- **Constraint-based validation** with refinement types
- **Pattern constraints** for data validation
- **Total functions** with comprehensive error reporting

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Language Reference** - Understand the complete syntax
2. **Explore Examples** - See practical use cases in action
3. **Learn Constraint Validation** - Create robust, validated types
4. **Practice with Examples** - Apply what you've learned

## Key Features

- **Turing-incomplete by design** - All programs terminate
- **Strong type safety** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Pattern matching** - Powerful data transformation
- **Module system** - Organize and reuse code
- **Constraint validation** - Ensure data correctness
