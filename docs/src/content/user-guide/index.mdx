## What is Ligature?

Ligature is a Turing-incomplete configuration and data management language designed with correctness and safety as primary goals. It provides:

- **Turing-incomplete by design** - All programs are guaranteed to terminate
- **Dependently-typed foundation** - Based on Lean 4 type theory
- **ML-family syntax** - Familiar and accessible syntax inspired by OCaml and Elm
- **Configuration-focused** - Optimized for configuration management and data validation
- **Strong correctness guarantees** - Total functions with comprehensive error reporting

## Key Features

### Language Features

- **Union types** with full evaluation and pattern matching
- **Advanced pattern matching** with guards and variable binding
- **Complete module system** with imports and exports
- **Type inference** and constraint solving
- **Operator precedence** system
- **Import resolution** and module loading
- **Type-level computation** with advanced subtyping and dependent types
- **Constraint-based validation** with refinement types and pattern constraints

### System Integration

- **XDG Base Directory compliance** - Follows Linux/Unix standards
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Multiple configuration formats** - JSON, YAML, and TOML support
- **Component isolation** - Each component gets its own subdirectory

### Development Tools

- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** - Professional-grade IDE integration with advanced features
- **Command-line interface** - Comprehensive CLI tools
- **Package management** - Keywork package manager
- **Client SDKs** - Krox client framework
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in performance analysis tools
- **Cacophony CLI** - Configuration orchestration and deployment
- **Symbol Finding** - Cross-file navigation and workspace search
- **Import Resolution** - Complete module resolution with dependency tracking
