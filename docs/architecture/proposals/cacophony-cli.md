# Cacophony CLI Proposal: Ligature Orchestration Tool

## Overview

This proposal outlines the design and implementation of `cacophony`, a Rust-based CLI tool for orchestrating collections of Ligature programs. Inspired by tools like Tanka but purpose-agnostic, cacophony will provide a unified interface for managing, deploying, and operating Ligature-based configurations across multiple environments and use cases.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Purpose-Agnostic**: Cacophony is not tied to any specific domain (Kubernetes, infrastructure, etc.) but can orchestrate any Ligature-based configuration
2. **Register-Centric**: Built around Ligature's register system for dependency management and code organization
3. **Environment-Aware**: Supports multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with environment-specific configurations
4. **Declarative Operations**: All operations are defined declaratively in Ligature, not imperatively in the CLI
5. **Type-Safe Orchestration**: Leverages Ligature's type system to ensure configuration correctness across environments
6. **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom operations and integrations

### Terminology

- **Orchestration**: The process of managing and coordinating multiple Ligature programs
- **Environment**: A deployment target (dev, staging, prod, etc.)
- **Collection**: A group of related Ligature programs that work together
- **Operation**: A specific action performed on a collection (deploy, validate, diff, etc.)
- **Plugin**: An extension that adds custom operations or integrations
- **Manifest**: A Ligature file that defines the orchestration configuration

### Core Components

#### 1. CLI Interface (`cli.rs`)

The main CLI interface provides commands for managing collections:

```rust
#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    /// Initialize a new cacophony project
    Init {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        template: Option<String>,
    },
    
    /// Deploy a collection to an environment
    Deploy {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        collection: String,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        environment: String,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        dry_run: bool,
    },
    
    /// Validate configurations
    Validate {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        collection: Option<String>,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        environment: Option<String>,
    },
    
    /// Show differences between environments
    Diff {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        collection: String,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        from: String,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        to: String,
    },
    
    /// List available collections and environments
    List {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        collections: bool,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        environments: bool,
    },
    
    /// Run custom operations
    Run {
        #[arg(short, long)]
        operation: String,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        collection: Option<String>,
        #[arg(short, long)]
        environment: Option<String>,
    },
}
```

#### 2. Configuration Management (`config.rs`)

Handles cacophony-specific configuration and project metadata:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct CacophonyConfig {
    pub project: ProjectConfig,
    pub environments: HashMap<String, EnvironmentConfig>,
    pub collections: HashMap<String, CollectionConfig>,
    pub plugins: Vec<PluginConfig>,
    pub operations: HashMap<String, OperationConfig>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct ProjectConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub authors: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct EnvironmentConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub variables: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub plugins: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct CollectionConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub dependencies: Vec<String>,
    pub operations: Vec<String>,
    pub environments: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### 3. Environment Management (`environment.rs`)

Manages environment-specific configurations and variable resolution:

```rust
pub struct Environment {
    pub name: String,
    pub config: EnvironmentConfig,
    pub variables: HashMap<String, Value>,
    pub plugins: Vec<Box<dyn Plugin>>,
}

impl Environment {
    pub fn load(&mut self, path: &Path) -> Result<()> {
        // Load environment-specific Ligature files
        // Resolve variables and plugins
    }
    
    pub fn resolve_variables(&self, template: &str) -> Result<String> {
        // Resolve variables in templates
    }
    
    pub fn get_plugin(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&Box<dyn Plugin>> {
        // Get plugin by name
    }
}
```

#### 4. Collection Management (`collection.rs`)

Manages collections of Ligature programs:

```rust
pub struct Collection {
    pub name: String,
    pub config: CollectionConfig,
    pub programs: Vec<LigatureProgram>,
    pub dependencies: Vec<Collection>,
}

impl Collection {
    pub fn load(&mut self, path: &Path) -> Result<()> {
        // Load collection Ligature files
        // Resolve dependencies
    }
    
    pub fn validate(&self, environment: &Environment) -> Result<ValidationResult> {
        // Validate collection against environment
    }
    
    pub fn deploy(&self, environment: &Environment) -> Result<DeployResult> {
        // Deploy collection to environment
    }
    
    pub fn diff(&self, from_env: &Environment, to_env: &Environment) -> Result<DiffResult> {
        // Generate diff between environments
    }
}
```

#### 5. Operation System (`operation.rs`)

Defines and executes operations on collections:

```rust
pub trait Operation {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    fn execute(&self, collection: &Collection, environment: &Environment) -> Result<OperationResult>;
    fn validate(&self, collection: &Collection, environment: &Environment) -> Result<ValidationResult>;
}

pub struct DeployOperation;
pub struct ValidateOperation;
pub struct DiffOperation;
pub struct CustomOperation {
    pub name: String,
    pub script: String,
    pub parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
}
```

#### 6. Plugin System (`plugin.rs`)

Extensible plugin system for custom integrations:

```rust
pub trait Plugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn version(&self) -> &str;
    fn operations(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn Operation>>;
    fn configure(&mut self, config: &Value) -> Result<()>;
}

pub struct KubernetesPlugin;
pub struct TerraformPlugin;
pub struct DockerPlugin;
```

## Ligature Integration

### Cacophony Manifest (`cacophony.lig`)

Each cacophony project includes a main manifest file:

```ligature
-- cacophony.lig
module Cacophony

-- Project metadata
let project = {
  name = "my-microservices",
  version = "1.0.0",
  description = "Microservices orchestration with cacophony",
  authors = ["team@example.com"]
}

-- Environment definitions
let environments = {
  dev = {
    name = "development",
    description = "Development environment",
    variables = {
      "DATABASE_URL" = "postgresql://localhost:5432/dev",
      "API_BASE_URL" = "http://localhost:8080",
      "LOG_LEVEL" = "debug"
    },
    plugins = ["docker", "kubernetes"]
  },
  
  staging = {
    name = "staging",
    description = "Staging environment",
    variables = {
      "DATABASE_URL" = "postgresql://staging-db:5432/staging",
      "API_BASE_URL" = "https://staging-api.example.com",
      "LOG_LEVEL" = "info"
    },
    plugins = ["kubernetes", "terraform"]
  },
  
  prod = {
    name = "production",
    description = "Production environment",
    variables = {
      "DATABASE_URL" = "postgresql://prod-db:5432/prod",
      "API_BASE_URL" = "https://api.example.com",
      "LOG_LEVEL" = "warn"
    },
    plugins = ["kubernetes", "terraform", "monitoring"]
  }
}

-- Collection definitions
let collections = {
  frontend = {
    name = "frontend",
    description = "Frontend application",
    dependencies = ["shared-types"],
    operations = ["deploy", "validate", "test"],
    environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  },
  
  backend = {
    name = "backend",
    description = "Backend API service",
    dependencies = ["shared-types", "database"],
    operations = ["deploy", "validate", "test", "migrate"],
    environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  },
  
  database = {
    name = "database",
    description = "Database configuration and migrations",
    dependencies = [],
    operations = ["deploy", "migrate", "backup"],
    environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  }
}

-- Custom operations
let operations = {
  migrate = {
    name = "migrate",
    description = "Run database migrations",
    script = "scripts/migrate.sh",
    parameters = {
      "timeout" = 300,
      "retries" = 3
    }
  },
  
  test = {
    name = "test",
    description = "Run integration tests",
    script = "scripts/test.sh",
    parameters = {
      "parallel" = true,
      "coverage" = true
    }
  }
}

-- Export configuration
export { project, environments, collections, operations }
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Each environment can have its own configuration file:

```ligature
-- environments/dev.lig
module Dev

let overrides = {
  variables = {
    "DEBUG" = true,
    "CACHE_TTL" = 60
  },
  
  collections = {
    frontend = {
      replicas = 1,
      resources = {
        cpu = "100m",
        memory = "128Mi"
      }
    },
    
    backend = {
      replicas = 1,
      resources = {
        cpu = "200m",
        memory = "256Mi"
      }
    }
  }
}

export { overrides }
```

### Collection Configuration

Each collection defines its specific configuration:

```ligature
-- collections/frontend.lig
module Frontend

let config = {
  name = "frontend",
  type = "web",
  
  build = {
    dockerfile = "Dockerfile",
    context = ".",
    target = "production"
  },
  
  deploy = {
    replicas = 2,
    resources = {
      cpu = "500m",
      memory = "512Mi"
    },
    
    ports = [{
      container = 80,
      service = 8080,
      protocol = "http"
    }],
    
    health_check = {
      path = "/health",
      port = 80,
      initial_delay = 30,
      period = 10
    }
  },
  
  environment = {
    "NODE_ENV" = "production",
    "API_URL" = "${API_BASE_URL}",
    "FEATURE_FLAGS" = "new_ui,beta_features"
  }
}

export { config }
```

pub struct CustomPlugin {
    name: String,
    operations: Vec<Box<dyn Operation>>,
}

impl Plugin for CustomPlugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    
    fn operations(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn Operation>> {
        self.operations.clone()
    }
}

// Custom operation example
pub struct CustomOperation {
    name: String,
    script: String,
}

impl Operation for CustomOperation {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    
    fn execute(&self, collection: &Collection, environment: &Environment) -> Result<OperationResult> {
        // Execute custom script with collection and environment context
        let script = environment.resolve_variables(&self.script)?;
