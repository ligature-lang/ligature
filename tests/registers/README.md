# Register Tests

This directory contains test files for the Ligature language organized by category:

## Directory Structure

- **`basic/`** - Basic language constructs and simple examples
- **`feature_tests/`** - Tests for specific language features (functions, records, pattern matching, etc.)
- **`error_tests/`** - Tests that should produce type errors or other errors
- **`examples/`** - Complete examples demonstrating real-world usage

## Test Categories

### Basic Tests
Simple tests covering fundamental language constructs like literals, basic operations, and type annotations.

### Feature Tests
Tests for specific language features including:
- Function definitions and applications
- Record construction and field access
- Pattern matching with different patterns
- Lambda expressions and currying
- Lists and collections

### Error Tests
Tests designed to trigger various types of errors:
- Type errors (mismatched types, invalid operations)
- Function signature errors
- Record field access errors
- Pattern matching errors

### Examples
Complete, realistic examples showing how Ligature can be used for practical applications like configuration management.

## Running Tests

These test files are used by the Ligature test suite to verify language functionality, type checking, and error handling.
